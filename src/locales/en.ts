    title: "About QQ Show 2000",
    description:
      "QQ Show was a virtual avatar dress-up feature launched by Tencent in 2003 and shut down in 2021. Users could customize their digital personas with clothing and accessories that appeared in QQ chats.",
    features:
      "QQ Show was directly inspired by Sayclub, one of Korea's biggest chat platforms in the 2000s, which lost its ground 10 years later. In a different trajectory, Tencent won its home market with its technology and product strategy. QQ Show achieved massive scale in China, attracting over 100 million users and establishing virtual goods as a major revenue stream.",
    featureList: [
      'The aesthetic featured the "purikura" and "blingee" style popular in early 2000s Asiaâ€”sparkly graphics, bright colors, and maximalist design elements that were part of the broader Y2K cultural movement.',
      "Despite shaping the internet culture and aesthetic for hundreds of millions of users in China, QQ Show remains relatively unknown outside the Chinese internet spheres.",
      "This project recreates QQ Show using gif assets recovered from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, aiming to make its mark on internet history visible to the global internet community.",
    ],
    conclusion:
      'All assets recovered from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Copyright remains with Tencent. Made by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kayzeng777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kay Zeng</a>, thinking about the QQ Show she bought with her snack money.',
